
## patch

1. Don’t Rely on It for Security: Use proper authentication (passwords) for sensitive areas instead of just Disallow.

2. Avoid Specific Listings: Don’t list exact file names (e.g., Disallow: /secret.pdf)—block entire directories if needed.

3. Use Wildcards Wisely: Disallow: /private/* is safer than listing every subdirectory.
