## patches:

To prevent such exploits, developers could:
Sign Cookies: Use a secret key to sign the cookie, ensuring that any tampering invalidates it.

Server-Side Validation: Store admin status in a server-side session linked to a secure session ID, rather than trusting client-side data.

Encryption: Encrypt the cookie to prevent attackers from reading or modifying its contents.

Secure Cookies: Set the Secure and HttpOnly flags on cookies to prevent client-side scripts from accessing them and ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS connections.
