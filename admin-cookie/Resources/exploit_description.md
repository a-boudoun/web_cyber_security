
## Exploit: Cookie Manipulation

Cookie Manipulation is a type of web application attack where an attacker modifies the data stored in cookies to bypass security mechanisms, gain unauthorized access, or escalate privileges. This exploit takes advantage of the fact that cookies are stored on the client-side (in the user's browser) and can be easily tampered with if the web application does not properly protect or validate them.

In this specific scenario, the exploit involves a cookie named "I_am_admin" that determines whether a user has administrative privileges. The cookie's value is set to the MD5 hash of either "false" (indicating a non-admin user) or "true" (indicating an admin user). The attacker discovers that the initial value is the MD5 hash of "false" and replaces it with the MD5 hash of "true" (calculated as "b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09") using browser developer tools. Upon refreshing the page or navigating to a restricted area, the server accepts the modified cookie and grants admin access, allowing the attacker to retrieve a flag or perform privileged actions.


## MD5 Hash Function
MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value, typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal string. It is designed to verify data integrity by generating a fixed-length fingerprint for any input. However, due to vulnerabilities like collision attacks, MD5 is no longer considered secure for cryptographic applications.
