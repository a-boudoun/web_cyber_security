Parameter tampering is a type of web-based cyber attack in which certain parameters in a URL are changed without a user's authorization. In some cases, the data entered by a user into a form field of a webpage may also be modified -- again, without the user's authorization. The attack may point the browser to a link, page or site that the user did not intend to access.
