## Overview
This project is part of the 42 Network curriculum and focuses on analyzing and exploiting security vulnerabilities in a web application. The goal is to understand common security breaches, document the exploitation process, and suggest potential fixes.

## Folder Structure

## Contents
- **Flag**: A file indicating successful exploitation of the vulnerability.
- **Resources/**: 
  - `exploit_description.txt`: Explanation of the identified vulnerability.
  - `Steps_to_reproduce.txt`: Detailed steps to exploit the vulnerability.
  - `Patch.txt`: Proposed fix to mitigate the issue.
  - `script.extention`: Any script used in the exploitation process.

## How to Use
1. Read `exploit_description.txt` to understand the vulnerability.
2. Follow `Steps_to_reproduce.txt` to replicate the exploit.
3. Review `Patch.txt` for recommended fixes.
4. (If applicable) Use `script.extention` to automate part of the exploitation.
