Encode data on output 
When you need to safely display data exactly as a user types it in, you should encode the output

In order for an XSS attack to be successful, an attacker must be able to insert and execute malicious content in a webpage. Thus, all variables in a web application needs to be protected. Ensuring that all variables go through validation and are then escaped or sanitized is known as perfect injection resistance. Any variable that does not go through this process is a potential weakness.
