An Open Redirect Vulnerability is a security flaw in a web application that allows an attacker to redirect users to any URL of their choosing by manipulating an unvalidated or poorly validated input parameter. This typically occurs when the application uses user-supplied data (e.g., a URL parameter like site in index.php?page=redirect&site=facebook) to determine the destination of a redirect without properly restricting it. Attackers can exploit this to redirect users to malicious sites, such as phishing pages or malware hosts, often making the attack appear legitimate because it originates from a trusted domain.

## how it works

An attacker crafts a URL, such as index.php?page=redirect&site=https://malicious-site.com.

The web application processes the site parameter and uses it to construct a redirect response (e.g., an HTTP 302 Found with a Location header pointing to the malicious URL).

The user’s browser follows the redirect, landing on the attacker’s site, which could steal credentials, install malware, or deceive the user into trusting it.

This vulnerability is especially risky because it can bypass security checks (e.g., domain allow lists) and exploit user trust in the original site.
