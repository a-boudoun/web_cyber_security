## Path Traversal Attack

A Path Traversal Attack (also known as Directory Traversal or Dot-Dot-Slash Attack) is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates file paths in a web application to access files and directories outside the intended scope. By using special sequences like ../ (move up one directory) or encoded variants (e.g., %2e%2e%2f), attackers can bypass restrictions and read sensitive files such as configuration files, password files (e.g., /etc/passwd on Unix systems), or even source code.
How It Works
In a web application, user input is often used to specify a file or resource to access. For example, a URL like http://example.com/index.php?page=profile might load profile.php from a designated directory (e.g., /var/www/html/pages/profile.php). If the application doesnâ€™t properly sanitize this input, an attacker can manipulate it to something like http://example.com/index.php?page=../etc/passwd, potentially tricking the server into serving /etc/passwd instead.
Example Payloads:
../etc/passwd (Unix/Linux)

../../windows/win.ini (Windows)

....//....//etc/passwd (bypassing simple filters)

Goal: Access restricted files, extract sensitive data, or even execute arbitrary code if combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., Local File Inclusion).

Real-World Impact
Data Exposure: Leaking system files like /etc/passwd can reveal user accounts or system details.

Escalation: Gaining access to configuration files might lead to further exploits.

CTF Context: In Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, path traversal often reveals a "flag" file as a proof-of-concept.

## etc/passwd File
The /etc/passwd file is a standard Unix/Linux text file that stores essential information about user accounts. Each line represents a user account and contains details like username, user ID, group ID, home directory, and default shell. While it doesn't store passwords directly (they are usually hashed in /etc/shadow), /etc/passwd can still provide valuable insights for attackers, especially in combination with other vulnerabilities.
