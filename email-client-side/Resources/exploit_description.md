storing credentials on the client-side is a common security risk, as it exposes sensitive information to potential attackers. In this scenario, the email client application stores the user's email and password in a form field, allowing anyone with access to the browser to view or extract this data. This vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to steal user credentials and gain unauthorized access to email accounts or other services.
