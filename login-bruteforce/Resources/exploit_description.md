## bruteforce

A brute-force attack is a hacking method where an attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of passwords, encryption keys, or other credentials until they find the correct one. It is time-consuming but effective, especially for weak passwords or insecure hashing algorithms like MD5. To prevent brute-force attacks, strong passwords, rate limiting, and secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 are recommended.
