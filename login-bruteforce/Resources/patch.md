## patches:

To prevent such exploits, developers could:

implement a CAPTCHA challenge to prevent automated login attempts.

Rate Limiting: Limit the number of login attempts per IP address or account to prevent brute-force attacks.

Strong Password Policy: Enforce password complexity requirements (e.g., length, character types) to make brute-force attacks more difficult.

2FA/MFA: Implement two-factor authentication or multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.
