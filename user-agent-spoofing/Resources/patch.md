## patch

### Protecting Against Referrer Spoofing

Don’t Rely Solely on Referrers for Security

Why: The HTTP Referer header is client-controlled and easily faked.

Fix: Avoid using it as the sole check for access (e.g., “only allow requests from mydomain.com”). Instead, use server-side tokens or authentication (like OAuth, CSRF tokens).

Implement a Strict Referrer Policy
How: Set the Referrer-Policy header in your server config or HTML meta tag. Options like strict-origin-when-cross-origin or no-referrer limit what referrer info is sent or received.


## protecting against user-agent-spoofing

Reduce Dependency on User-Agent Checks
Why: Like the Referer header, the User-Agent is client-controlled and trivial to fake.

Fix: Don’t use it as a primary gatekeeper (e.g., “block all non-Chrome users”). Rely on behavior or authenticated sessions instead.

Leverage Client Hints Sparingly
Modern browsers support HTTP Client Hints (e.g., Sec-CH-UA for user-agent data), which are harder to spoof fully since they’re tied to browser internals.

Rate Limiting and Bot Detection
How: Use CAPTCHAs, IP-based rate limiting, or bot detection services (e.g., Cloudflare, reCAPTCHA) to catch spoofed agents used in scraping or abuse.
