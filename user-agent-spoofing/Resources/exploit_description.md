## spoofing
Spoofing is a broad term for the type of behavior that involves a cybercriminal masquerading as a trusted entity or device to get you to do something beneficial to the hacker — and detrimental to you. Any time an online scammer disguises their identity as something else, it’s spoofing.

Spoofing can apply to a range of communication channels and can involve different levels of technical complexity. Spoofing attacks usually involve an element of social engineering, where scammers psychologically manipulate their victims by playing on human vulnerabilities such as fear, greed, or lack of technical knowledge.

## user-agent-spoofing
A user agent string is a string of data that browsers send when requesting content from websites or ad servers. The data contains information on the browser, such as version, device type, and operating system, and when the website or ad servers receives the request, it is able to return content or ads that will render correctly – for example, serving mobile-optimised content to a mobile device.

User-agent spoofing is a form of fraud where the string of data is modified to provide false information or hide details – for example, a bot making multiple automated requests for content from a single device could modify the user agent string to pretend those requests (and the resulting impressions) are from multiple devices.

you can weaponize it by:

Bypass Browser or Device Restrictions
Scenario: A site blocks outdated browsers (e.g., “Upgrade from IE6”) or serves mobile-only content.


Access Device-Specific Features
Scenario: A site offers discounts or content only to mobile users.

Evade Bot Detection
Scenario: A site blocks requests from known bot User-Agents (e.g., “Python-urllib”) or requires human-like clients.



## referrer-spoofing
Referrer spoofing is a technique used to manipulate or fake the "referrer" information sent in an HTTP request when you visit a website. Normally, when you click a link, your browser sends a "Referer" header (yes, it’s spelled that way in HTTP, despite "referrer" being the correct English spelling) to the destination site, telling it the URL of the page you came from. Spoofing this involves altering that header to show a different source—or none at all—for various reasons like privacy, testing, or bypassing restrictions.

you can weaponize it by:
Bypass Referrer-Based Access Controls
Scenario: A site only allows requests from a trusted domain (e.g., trusted.com) by checking the Referer header.


Evade Hotlink Protection
Scenario: A site blocks direct access to resources (e.g., images) unless the request comes from its own pages.

Hide Traffic Sources in Scraping
Scenario: A site blocks requests from known scraper tools or external domains.
